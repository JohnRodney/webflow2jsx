# Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Make an alias to your directory like `alias webflow=~/path/to/main`

# Use

Type the name of any html file while in that directory after the webflow command
`webflow index`

This will parse index html and create index.jsx with the changes needed to convert to more jsx like syntax.

# Future

Still alot of work to do as it expects your html file to exist and also expects it to already be properly formatted html.
